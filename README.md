# Histordl
####H istordl is a Wordle clone based on a historical event related to the current date that runs in the command line. 

# Background
This is a personal project created for the purposes of showcasing my skills in Python and background in linguistics/computational linguistics. 
The project is still a work in progress. I am currently in the process of building out a word list for relevant words related to an event in history. 

The project uses Python 3 and utilizes Wikipedia's On This Day API
